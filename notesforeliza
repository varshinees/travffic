General thoughts:
Displaying photos three/row taking up 75% of screen improves visibility but not necessarily enough to see
for certain that road conditions are safe, plus the proportions look uglier than 2/3 route 1/3 side bar. Consider
adding functionality for clicking on (or even just hovering) over a certain image to expand it and get a better view

QOL edit-- add the time + date the photo is from to the caption

Also, if weather map is going to be displaying on the right side, consider making this a block that can "slide" as
the user scrolls down the footage, so they don't have to scroll back up to reference the route. Might need to use some
of the "sidebar" code from the original template for this


To-do:
- Get a list of all the traffic cameras (in order) along at least one route, put into a csv for the tableau display
