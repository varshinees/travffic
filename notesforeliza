General thoughts:
Displaying photos three/row taking up 75% of screen improves visibility but not necessarily enough to see
for certain that road conditions are safe, plus the proportions look uglier than 2/3 route 1/3 side bar. Consider
adding functionality for clicking on (or even just hovering) over a certain image to expand it and get a better view

QOL edit-- add the time + date the photo is from to the caption

Also, if weather map is going to be displaying on the right side, consider making this a block that can "slide" as
the user scrolls down the footage, so they don't have to scroll back up to reference the route. Might need to use some
of the "sidebar" code from the original template for this

Some cameras have no images (e.g. camera status) but also don't show the "This image is unavailable" image, we should
consider putting in a placeholder image for these, possibly with a caption over that is always shown with the details
of the location
Example: 51ST ST/35 SVRD has no image, in the database the camera status is "REMOVED"

Possible safety concern: if there's any Q&A for our presentation someone may ask us about potential safety concerns
(e.g. someone could hypothetically use our site to stalk someone)
Personally I feel like the concern about this camera footage being abused is valid, but our website isn't showing
anything that isn't already pretty easily accessible by the public, and isn't set up in a way that would be conducive
to following any particular person, or easily monitoring a particular place over time. Therefore I don't think our
site is creating any NEW issues, but an argument could certainly be made that the City of Austin's public camera data
is itself problematic.
